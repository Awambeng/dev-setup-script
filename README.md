# Developer Setup Script for Ubuntu and macOS

This script automates the installation of essential development tools on a newly installed Ubuntu or macOS machine. It includes the latest versions of software commonly used by developers, such as Docker, Java, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, and more. Additionally, it sets up SSH keys for GitHub authentication and configures Git for commit signing, with an option to skip the SSH setup.

## Features

- Installs essential development tools, including:
  - Docker
  - Java (OpenJDK) with version selection
  - Maven
  - Node.js and npm
  - IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
  - Visual Studio Code
  - VLC Media Player
  - Discord
  - Google Chrome
  - Multipass
- Optionally sets up SSH keys for GitHub authentication
- Configures Git for commit signing with SSH keys
- Automatically detects the operating system (Ubuntu or macOS) and installs appropriate packages

## Prerequisites

- This script is intended for Ubuntu and macOS systems. Ensure you have a freshly installed environment.
- You need to have sudo privileges to install software on Ubuntu.
- On macOS, ensure you have Homebrew installed.

## Usage

1. **Clone this repository** or download the script to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dev-setup-script.git
    cd dev-setup-script
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

    ```bash
    chmod +x install_dev_tools.sh
    ```

3. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    ./install_dev_tools.sh
    ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
    - The script will automatically detect your operating system and ask you for your desired Java version and your GitHub email to generate SSH keys and configure Git.
    - You will also have the option to skip the SSH setup if you do not need GitHub SSH keys.

5. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account** (if you chose to set up SSH keys):
    - After running the script, copy the generated public SSH key from the terminal and add it to your GitHub account under **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the script to include any additional tools or configurations you may need for your specific development environment.
